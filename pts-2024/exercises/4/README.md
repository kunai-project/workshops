# Realistic Use Case 

You now have the necessary foundations to handle a more realistic example.

# Instructions

1. choose a malware sample in **malware-dataset**. Choose well, some are easier than others.
2. use **kunai-search.py** to **inspect** the activity generated by your sample.
3. find suspicious events and encode them either as **IoCs** or as **detection** rules.
4. verify that what you've done works as intended by using kunai's `replay` command. **DO NOT RUN MALWARE SAMPLES (unless you know what you are doing)**.
